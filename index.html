	<dt><strong>Bouquet (2015)</strong></dt>
	<dd>Bouquet lacks the allure of later albums, but serves as their prototype by setting the groundwork for the harmonic tunes of its successors. <span class="attention">New York City</span> and <span class="attention">Roses</span> attempt to convey similar messages from
	more recent songs, but the product of its lyrics alludes to the appeal of nothing more than the music-based equivalent of an overused damp rag. One redeeming quality is the trendy minimalism used throughout the album cover, which 
	gives it the potential to establish itself with the younger crowds.</dd>

	<dt><strong>Collage (2016)</strong></dt>
	<dd>Collage is by far the best album released. Due to the number of high-profile guest singers, the combination of good vocals and vibrant electropop techniques sent the aesthetics of the music over the top.
	It drew fans of Halsey, Daya, and XYLO closer to the record-breaking band.
	<span class="attention">Closer</span> topped the album with its connection to the challenges of young millennials through its meaningful and dynamic lyrics.  </dd>

<dl>
	<dt><strong>Memories...Do Not Open (2017)</strong></dt>
	<dd>This recent album is a succesful continuation of the artistic rhythms found in Collage. Mixed with the vocal expertise of Coldplay, <span class="attention">Something Just Like This</span> creates an uplifting and inspiring melody
	directed towards its listeners. At the same time, however, it captures the foundation of realism by promoting everyday success. Such a theme also appears to surface throughout the album cover.</dd>
